11)import mysql.connector in Getconn file

12)Use connect () method to connect to the database.

For Xampp 

servername=”localhost”

username=”root”

password=””

databasename=”library”

mydb = my.connect(host='localhost',user='root',passwd='',database='library')

13)creating cursor

self.mydb=getconn()

self.cur=self.mydb.cursor()
